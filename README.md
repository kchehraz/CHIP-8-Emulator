# CHIP-8-Emulator
A CHIP-8 Emulator implemented in C++ with the SDL library. This was pretty much entirely written using the following resources:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

To compile the project, you must have SDL2 libraries included. The files SDL Development Libraries can be found at:
http://libsdl.org/

Setting up SDL2 with your Visual Studio 2017 (what I used to create this project) is made very easy with this tutorial:
